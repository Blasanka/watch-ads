This file is here, if you confused, what the hack I am doing:

ads.json file is in the same project to place on my github pages(somewhere on the internet if you want to)
and to show you guys how to fetch data from the internet. Otherwise, we can use this file with Flutter asset
bundle without fetching using http.


Regards!
